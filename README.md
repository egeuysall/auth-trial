# Auth Trial

**Auth Trial** is a minimal experimental repository for testing and iterating on authentication logic, including user sign-up, login, and token handling. Itâ€™s designed to quickly prototype and validate auth flows using Go, Supabase, or other backend services, with a focus on simplicity and modularity for future integration into larger projects.
